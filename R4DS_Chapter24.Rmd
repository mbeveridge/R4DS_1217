## 24. "Model building" [Chapter 19 hardcopy]
### 24.2.3 Exercises

Q1. In the plot of `lcarat` vs. `lprice`, there are some bright vertical strips. What do they represent?

A1.

-----------

Q2. If `log(price) = a_0 + a_1 * log(carat)`, what does that say about the relationship between `price` and `carat`?

A2.

-----------

Q3.
Extract the diamonds that have very high and very low residuals. Is there anything unusual about these diamonds? Are theY particularly bad or good, or do you think these are pricing errors?

A3.

-----------

Q4.
Does the final model, `mod_diamonds2`, do a good job of predicting diamond prices?
Would you trust it to tell you how much to spend if you were buying a diamond?

A4.

### 24.3.5 Exercises

Q1.
Use your Google sleuthing skills to brainstorm why there were fewer than expected flights on Jan 20, May 26, and Sep 1.
(Hint: they all have the same explanation.) How would these days generalise to another year?

A1.

-----------

Q2.
What do the three days with high positive residuals represent? How would these days generalise to another year?

```{r}
daily %>% 
  top_n(3, resid)
```

#> # A tibble: 3 × 5
#>         date     n  wday resid   term
#>       <date> <int> <ord> <dbl> <fctr>
#> 1 2013-11-30   857   Sat 112.4   fall
#> 2 2013-12-01   987   Sun  95.5   fall
#> 3 2013-12-28   814   Sat  69.4   fall

Q3.
Create a new variable that splits the `wday` variable into terms, but only for Saturdays,
i.e. it should have `Thurs`, `Fri`, but `Sat-summer`, `Sat-spring`, `Sat-fall`.
How does this model compare with the model with every combination of wday and term?

A3.

-----------

Q4.
Create a new `wday` variable that combines the day of week, term (for Saturdays), and public holidays. What do the residuals of that model look like?

A4.

-----------

Q5.
What happens if you fit a day of week effect that varies by month (i.e. `n ~ wday * month`)?
Why is this not very helpful?

A5.

-----------

Q6.
What would you expect the model `n ~ wday + ns(date, 5)` to look like?
Knowing what you know about the data, why would you expect it to be not particularly effective?

A6.

-----------

Q7.
We hypothesised that people leaving on Sundays are more likely to be business travellers who need to be somewhere on Monday. Explore that hypothesis by seeing how it breaks down based on distance and time: if it’s true, you’d expect to see more Sunday evening flights to places that are far away

A7.

-----------

Q8.
It’s a little frustrating that Sunday and Saturday are on separate ends of the plot.
Write a small function to set the levels of the factor so that the week starts on Monday

A8.
